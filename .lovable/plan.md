## Fix: Restore the .env File

### Root Cause
The `.env` file was accidentally created/overwritten in the previous edit, replacing the auto-generated Lovable Cloud configuration. This file is managed automatically and should never be edited manually. Without it, the app has no backend connection credentials.

### Fix
The `.env` file is auto-generated by Lovable Cloud. Simply deleting the manually-created version will allow the system to regenerate it with the correct values:

**Delete the manually-created `.env` file** so that Lovable Cloud can auto-populate it with the correct `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`.

This is a one-line fix — no code changes needed beyond removing the bad `.env` file.
