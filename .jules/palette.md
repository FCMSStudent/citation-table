## 2025-05-14 - Actionable Search Examples

**Learning:** Example queries in a search interface should be actionable rather than just instructional. When a user clicks a "Try this" example, they expect the search to perform immediately. Populating the input without searching increases the interaction cost (requiring another click). Making these examples trigger the search directly creates a more fluid and "delightful" user experience.

**Action:** Ensure "Try this" example buttons in search-centric interfaces both populate the input and trigger the search action immediately.
